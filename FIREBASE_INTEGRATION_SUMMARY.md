   service cloud.firestore {
     match /databases/{database}/documents {
       match /enquiries/{document=**} {
         allow read: if false;
         allow write: if true;
       }
       match /eoi-submissions/{document=**} {
         allow read: if false;
         allow write: if true;
       }
     }
   }
   ```

   - Copy the `firebaseConfig` object

5. **Update firebase-config.js**

   - Replace placeholder values with your config:
   ```javascript
   const firebaseConfig = {
       apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE",
       authDomain: "your-project.firebaseapp.com",
       projectId: "your-project-id",
       // ... rest of config
   };
   ```

## 📊 Where Data is Stored

### Collection: `enquiries`
- Homepage contact form submissions
- Fields: name, email, phone, interest, budget, message

### Collection: `eoi-submissions`
- Property detail page EOI submissions
- Property popup submissions
- Fields: name, email, phone, property, tower, budget, nationality, interest

## 🧪 Testing

After setup, test each form:

1. **Homepage Form** (`index.html`)
   - Fill and submit contact form
   - Should see success message with enquiry number
   - Check Firebase Console → `enquiries` collection

2. **Property Forms** (`property-jacob-co.html` or `property-experion-151.html`)
   - Fill and submit main contact form
   - Should see success message with EOI number
   - Check Firebase Console → `eoi-submissions` collection

3. **Priority Popup**
   - Wait 3 seconds for popup
   - Fill and submit
   - Should see alert with EOI number
   - Check Firebase Console → `eoi-submissions` collection

## 📱 How Forms Work Now

### Before (WhatsApp):
```
User submits form → Opens WhatsApp → Opens email client → Manual tracking
```

### Now (Firebase):
```
User submits form → Saves to Firestore → Success message → Auto-organized in database
```
